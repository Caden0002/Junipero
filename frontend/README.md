# Junipero
I always wanted to do my part for the environment. Junipero is created to shed light on the critical issue of global warming and emphasizes individual efforts to protect our planet. Junipero not only addresses the alarming realities of climate change but also showcases practical ways in which each of us can make a positive impact on Mother Earth. Building Junipero has allowed me to integrate web scraping using Python to gather real life news and present it on the website.
